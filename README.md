# # House Price Prediction

## Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to develop a house price prediction system that can be used by real estate agents and individuals to get an estimate of the price of a house. The system will be developed using a machine learning model that will be trained on a dataset of house prices in the United States. The model will be trained using the Linear Regression algorithm.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It has 19 house features plus the price and the id columns, along with 21613 observations.

### Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used for this project is the Linear Regression algorithm. Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.

## Backend

Welcome to the backend of our House Price Prediction project to developed for Bogazici University MIS 463 - Decision Support Systems course. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the technologies and features implemented in the backend to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience.

### Technologies

The backend is built using the Strapi framework. Strapi is an open-source headless CMS that is based on Node.js. It is highly customizable and extensible using a plugin system. It also provides a powerful CLI that allows you to build, deploy and scale your applications easily. Strapi is built on top of Koa, a Node.js web framework, and it uses SQLite as a data store.

### `develop`
